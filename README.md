# hello-world

HEYOOOOOOOOOOO!!

This is my first program in GitHub

Hello my name is Muna and I am just in middle school and I'm learning to code. I want to learn how to code so that in the future I'll be able to make projects with code and get a career in software development or maybe as a data scientist (most likely a software developer). Right now I don't know much about programming. I also know the very very basics of Python and HTML and have decided to learn Javascript. I made a GitHub account because I heard lots of developers use this and hopefully one say I can become a developer. Wish me Luck as I start my software development journey.
